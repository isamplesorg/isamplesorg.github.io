**History**

* 2021-07-09  Remove Marine biome, Subaerial terrestrial environment, Subaqueous terrestrial environment per github issue https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata/issues/41. Make Experiment setting and Laboratory or curatorial environment subclasses of Active human occupation site.
* 2021-12-10 SMR add missing skos:inScheme statements
* 2022-01-07 SMR change to https://w3id.org/isample/ uri base, make the ConceptScheme an ontology as well. For uploading to ESIP COR and w3id resolution redirect set up. Add some mappings to other ontologies using seeAlso, closeMatch, narrowMatch.
* 2022-03-11 SMR change definitions from rdfs:comment to skos:definition. Minor fixes in definitions. Add skos matches to URIs from other vocabularies. Fix typo in glacierenvrionment URI (changed the URI to glacierenvironment)
* 2022-09-07 SMR update some of the skos mappings to other vocabularies; remove references to other vocabularies as NamedIndividual. Remove rocksample class, it was not linked in hierarchy and inconsistent with design.
* 2022-09-30 add biological entity as sampled feature, per issue https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata/issues/107. This update was lost at some point and added back in 2022-12-09.
* 2023-11-05 SMR update version to 1.0, prep for release
* 2024-04-19 SMR update definitions to remove use of 'specimen'. Edit some definitions for better clarity
* 2024-09-13 remove version numbers from URI

vocabulary.

###  Anthropogenic environment

Child of:
 [`anysampledfeature`](#anysampledfeature)

Sampled feature is produced by or related to human activity past or
present.

####  Active human occupation site

[]{#activehumanoccupationsite}

Concept: [`activehumanoccupationsite`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/sampledfeature/activehumanoccupationsite)

Child of:
 [`anthropogenicenvironment`](#anthropogenicenvironment)

sampled feature is a site at which there are ongoing human activities

#####  Experiment setting

[]{#experimentsetting}

Concept: [`experimentsetting`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/sampledfeature/experimentsetting)

Child of:
 [`activehumanoccupationsite`](#activehumanoccupationsite)

Sampled feature is an experimental set up that produced the sample;
the sample is the product of the experiment.

#####  Laboratory or curatorial environment

[]{#laboratorycuratorialenvironment}

Concept: [`laboratorycuratorialenvironment`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/sampledfeature/laboratorycuratorialenvironment)

Child of:
 [`activehumanoccupationsite`](#activehumanoccupationsite)

Sampled feature is a laboratory or other research site, collected with
intention of characterizing the environment in which data are
collected or other research conducted, that might affect results or
safety; e.g. lab blank measurements.

####  Site of past human activities

[]{#pasthumanoccupationsite}

Concept: [`pasthumanoccupationsite`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/sampledfeature/pasthumanoccupationsite)

their activity. Includes prehistoric and paleo hominid sites

###  Biological entity

[]{#biologicalentity}

Concept: [`biologicalentity`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/sampledfeature/biologicalentity)

Child of:
 [`anysampledfeature`](#anysampledfeature)

Sampled feature is an organism. Use for samples that represent some
species of organism as the proximate sampled feature, not the
environment that the organism inhabits.

###  Earth environment

[]{#earthenvironment}

Concept: [`earthenvironment`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/sampledfeature/earthenvironment)

Child of:
 [`anysampledfeature`](#anysampledfeature)

Sampled feature is the natural Earth environment
