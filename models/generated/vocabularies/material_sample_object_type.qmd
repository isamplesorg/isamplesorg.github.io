**History**

* 2022-01-07 SMR Change base URI to https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/, setting up resolution using w3id. Make the conceptScheme and ontology. Add Dublin core imports.
* 2022-03-11 SMR change definitions from rdfs:comment to skos:definition. Minor fixes in definitions. Add skos matches to URIs from other vocabularies.
* 2022-09-30 SMR per https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata/issues/109, change specimen to sample in vocabulary names and labels. Add 'Slurry biome aggregation' and 'Bundle biome aggregation' (github issue 110). Rename 'liquid or gas' sample type to 'fluid in container' (github issue 108).
* 2023-07-27 SMR modify base specimen type vocabulary, add 'Non biologic solid object'  change broader relations in this vocab to use that as parent class where appropriate.  Intention is a specimen category for solid objects that are not biologic; this subsumes 'Fossil' and 'Artifact', but excludes living organism, their parts and products. Obviously there is some overlap with Research specimens.
* 2023-11-06 SMR add missing inScheme on Non-biologic solid object and solid materal specimen. Update version number in URI to 1.0
* 2024-04-19 SMR update language to always use 'material sample' instead of specimen or physical specimen, including in text, labels, and in the URI tokens.  Edit defintions to improve clarity.
* 2024-09-13 remove version numbers from URI

##  Material sample

[]{#materialsample}

Concept: [`materialsample`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/materialsampleobjecttype/materialsample)

A material entity that represents an entity of interest in whole or in
part (http://rs.tdwg.org/dwc/terms/MaterialSample). Top concept in
material sample object type hierarchy.  Represents any material sample
object.

###  Any aggregation material sample

[]{#anyaggregation}

Concept: [`anyaggregation`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/materialsampleobjecttype/anyaggregation)

Child of:
 [`materialsample`](#materialsample)

Sample consists of a bunch of material fragments, not related to the
same object (e.g. not a bunch of broken pot sherds that might be
reassembled), but taken together representative of the sampled
feature. Examples: loose soil, sediment, crushed rock,  particulate,
bunches of unrelated pot sherd, human production waste, filtrates and
residues. The sample requires some kind of container to keep it
together. Cores of loosely consolidated material are considered 'Solid
material specimen' when preserved such that the internal parts have
spatial relationships (e.g. upper part, lower part, sedimentary
structures).

####  Anthropogenic aggregation

Concept: [`anthropogenicaggregation`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/materialsampleobjecttype/anthropogenicaggregation)

Child of:
 [`anyaggregation`](#anyaggregation)

An aggregate material sample consisting of fragments of material
produced by human activity, not described individually, and generally
not all originating from the same object.  Includes pottery in an
excavation unit that gets an aggregate description, production waste,
production raw-materials, or other residues (broken bits of plaster
from a destroyed wall), synthetic powders.

####  Biome aggregation sample

[]{#biomeaggregation}

Child of:
 [`biomeaggregation`](#biomeaggregation)

Material sample that consists of mixed organic and inorganic material,
including whole organisms and organism fragments.

####  Organism part

[]{#organismpart}

Concept: [`organismpart`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/materialsampleobjecttype/organismpart)

Child of:
 [`biologicalmaterialsample`](#biologicalmaterialsample)

Material sample that is part of an organism, e.g. a tissue sample,
plant leaf, flower, bird feather. Include internal parts not composed
of organic material (e.g. teeth, bone), and hard body parts that are
not shed (hoof, horn, tusk, claw).  Hair is tricky, include here for
now.  Does not necessarily imply existance of parent sample. Not
fossilized; generally includes organism parts native to deposits of
Holocene to Recent age.

Child of:
 [`biologicalmaterialsample`](#biologicalmaterialsample)

Material sample is a thing produced by some organism, generally not
composed of organic material or including biological tissue, e.g.
Shell, antler, egg shell, coral skeleton (organic tissue not
included), fecal matter, cocoon, web.  Consider internal parts not
composed of organic material (e.g. teeth, bone) and hard body parts
that are not shed (hoof, horn, tusk) to be organism parts.

####  Whole organism material sample

[]{#wholeorganism}

Concept: [`wholeorganism`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/materialsampleobjecttype/wholeorganism)

Child of:
 [`biologicalmaterialsample`](#biologicalmaterialsample)

Material sample consists of the bodies of one or more entire organisms
of the same species, from any kingdom.

###  Fluid in container

[]{#fluidincontainer}

Concept: [`fluidincontainer`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/materialsampleobjecttype/fluidincontainer)

Child of:
 [`materialsample`](#materialsample)

Material sample is a liquid, gas, or mixed dominantly fluid phase
material that is necessarily inside some container. Fluids might
include minor solid particles. The container is typically human made,
but also includes natural fluid containers, e.g. a fluid inclusion in
a mineral grain.  Fluids might be colloids, foams, gels, or
suspensions. The sample is the fluid substance; fluid samples
collected to analyze the contained biome should be considered 'Biome
aggregation sample'

###  Non biologic solid object

[]{#nonbiologicsolidobject}

Concept: [`nonbiologicsolidobject`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/materialsampleobjecttype/nonbiologicsolidobject)

Child of:
 [`nonbiologicsolidobject`](#nonbiologicsolidobject)

Material sample is the remains or trace of one or more organisms
preserved in rock; includes whole body, body parts (usually bone or
shell), and trace fossils. An organism or organism part becomes a
fossil when it has undergone some fossilization process that entails
physical and chemical changes akin to diagenesis in a sedimentary
rock. Includes trace fossils, which are manifestations of biologic
activity preserved in a rock body (typically sedimentary), without
included preserved body parts.

####  Other solid object

organism, that is intended to be representative of some material.

###  Research product

[]{#researchproduct}

Concept: [`researchproduct`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/materialsampleobjecttype/researchproduct)

Child of:
 [`materialsample`](#materialsample)

Material sample is a product of some research workflow, e.g. a thin
section, an XRF pellet, a grain mount, SEM stub, synthetic rock or
mineral ...  In general there should be a link to a parent material
sample from which this was derived.  Might be aggregation (e.g. a
synthetic material powder) or a solid object.

####  Analytical preparation

[]{#analyticalpreparation}

Child of:
 [`researchproduct`](#researchproduct)

Material sample is a product of processing required for some
observation procedure, e.g. thin section, XRF bead, SEM stub, rock
powder. If identified separately, this should have a ‘parent’ link to
the original sample

####  Experiment product

[]{#experimentalproduct}

Concept: [`experimentalproduct`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/materialsampleobjecttype/experimentalproduct)

Child of:
 [`researchproduct`](#researchproduct)

Material sample that is the product of an experimental procedure (e.g.
synthetic material)
