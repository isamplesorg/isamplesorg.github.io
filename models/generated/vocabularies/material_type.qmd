##  Material

[]{#material}

Concept: [`material`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/material)

Top Concept in iSamples Material Category scheme

###  Anthropogenic material

[]{#anyanthropogenicmaterial}

Concept: [`anyanthropogenicmaterial`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/anyanthropogenicmaterial)

Child of:
 [`material`](#material)

Material produced by human activity.

####  Anthropogenic metal material

[]{#anthropogenicmetal}

Concept: [`anthropogenicmetal`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/anthropogenicmetal)

Child of:
 [`anyanthropogenicmaterial`](#anyanthropogenicmaterial)

Metal that has been produced or used by humans. Samples of naturally
occurring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold nuggets) should
be considered mineral material. Metallic material is material that
when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts
electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable
(they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into
wires). The boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids
fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions
of the categories involved. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal, c.f.
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01001069)

####  Other anthropogenic material

[]{#otheranthropogenicmaterial}

Concept: [`otheranthropogenicmaterial`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/otheranthropogenicmaterial)

Child of:
 [`anyanthropogenicmaterial`](#anyanthropogenicmaterial)

Non-metallic material produced by human activity. Organic products of
agricultural activity are both anthropogenic and organic. Include lab
preparations like XRF pellet and rock powders. Examples: ceramics,
concrete, slag, (anthropogenic) glass, mine tailing, plaster, waste.

###  Any ice

[]{#anyice}

Concept: [`anyice`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/anyice)

Child of:
 [`material`](#material)

a material that is in a solid state under the temperature and pressure
conditions of the preserved sample, but is a liquid or gas at Standard
Temperature and Pressure (STP).

####  Frozen water

[]{#waterice}

Concept: [`waterice`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/waterice)

Child of:
 [`anyice`](#anyice)

Water that is in a solid state.

###  Biogenic non-organic material

[]{#biogenicnonorganicmaterial}

Concept: [`biogenicnonorganicmaterial`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/biogenicnonorganicmaterial)

Child of:
 [`material`](#material)

Material produced by an organism but not composed of 'very large
molecules of biological origin.' E.g. bone, tooth, shell, coral
skeleton,

###  Dispersed media

[]{#dispersedmedia}

Concept: [`dispersedmedia`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/dispersedmedia)

Child of:
 [`material`](#material)

Material that contains discrete elements of some material dispersed in
a continuous fluid medium.  The dispersed component can be a gas, a
liquid or a solid (based on
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersed_media). Does not include
mixtures of granular material like soil, sediment, particulate, or
solids that would be considered  rock material.

###  Natural Solid Material

[]{#earthmaterial}

Concept: [`earthmaterial`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/earthmaterial)

Child of:
 [`material`](#material)

A naturally occurring solid material that is not anthropogenic,
biogenic, or ice.

####  Mineral

[]{#mineral}

Concept: [`mineral`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/mineral)

Child of:
 [`earthmaterial`](#earthmaterial)

Material consists of a single mineral or mineraloid phase.  'A mineral
is an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and
that has been formed as a result of geological processes.' (Nickel,
Ernest H. (1995), The definition of a mineral, The Canadian
Mineralogist. 33 (3): 689–90). Include mineraloids. ... A material
primarily composed of some substance that is naturally occurring,
solid and stable at room temperature, representable by a chemical
formula, usually abiogenic, and that has an ordered atomic structure.
(http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000256). The identity of a
mineral species is defined by a crystal structure and a chemical
composition that might include various specific elemental
substitutions in that structure. Mineraloid: A naturally occurring
mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate crystallinity.
Mineraloids possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the
generally accepted ranges for specific minerals. Examples: obsidian,
Opal. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineraloid)

####  Mixed soil sediment or rock

[]{#mixedsoilsedimentrock}

Concept: [`mixedsoilsedimentrock`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/mixedsoilsedimentrock)

Child of:
 [`earthmaterial`](#earthmaterial)

Material is mixed aggregation of fragments of undifferentiated soil,
sediment or rock origin. e.g. cuttings from some boreholes (rock
fragments and caved soil or sediment).

####  Particulate

[]{#particulate}

Concept: [`particulate`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/particulate)

Child of:
 [`earthmaterial`](#earthmaterial)

Material consists of microscopic particulate material derived by
precipitation, filtering, or settling from suspension in a fluid, e.g.
filtrate from water, deposition from atmosphere, astro material
particles. Might include mineral, organic, or biological material.
ENVO definition (ENVO_01000060) has "composed of microscopic portions
of solid or liquid material suspended in another environmental
material." Refine here to define as the solid particles, distinct from
a material in which they are suspended. A material that includes solid
or liquid particles suspended in another material would be a
dispersed_media in this scheme, not defined in ENVO. Human
manufactured particulates (e.g. rock powder) should be categorized as
'Anthropogenic material' as well as 'Particulate'

####  Rock or sediment

[]{#rockorsediment}

Concept: [`rockorsediment`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/rockorsediment)

Child of:
 [`earthmaterial`](#earthmaterial)

Material is rock or sediment.  For example core from boreholes that
likely penetrate sediment near the surface and rock at greater depth,
with descriptions that do not clearly distinguish non-consolidated
sediment from rock.

#####  Rock

[]{#rock}

Concept: [`rock`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/rock)

Child of:
 [`rockorsediment`](#rockorsediment)

Consolidated aggregate of particles (grains) of rock, mineral
(including native elements), mineraloid, or solid organic material.
Includes mineral aggregates such as granite, shale, marble; natural
glass such as obsidian; organic material formed by geologic processes
such a coal;  extraterrestrial material in meteorites; and  crushed
rock fragments like drill cuttings from rock.  (based on
http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/rock, same as
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00001995)

#####  Sediment

[]{#sediment}

Concept: [`sediment`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/sediment)

Child of:
 [`rockorsediment`](#rockorsediment)

Solid granular material transported by wind, water, or gravity, not
modified by interaction with biosphere or atmosphere (to differentiate
from soil). Particles might be derived by erosion of pre-existing
rock, from shell or other body parts from organisms, precipitated
chemically in the surficial environment, or generated by explosive
volcanic activity.
(http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/sediment).
Sediment is not consolidated, i.e. the particulate constituents do not
adhere to each other strongly enough that the aggregate can be
considered a solid material in its own right. Similar to
http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00002007

####  Soil

[]{#soil}

Concept: [`soil`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/soil)

Child of:
 [`earthmaterial`](#earthmaterial)

Mixed granular mineral and organic matter modified by interaction
between earth material, biosphere, and atmosphere, consisting of
varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as
humus, gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and
macroorganisms. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil) Soil consists of
horizons near the Earth's surface that, in contrast to the underlying
parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate,
relief, and living organisms over time. (http://www.nrcs.usda.gov/wps/
portal/nrcs/detail/soils/edu/?cid=nrcs142p2_054280)

###  Fluid material

[]{#fluid}

Concept: [`fluid`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/fluid)

Child of:
 [`material`](#material)

Substance that continually deforms (flows) under an applied shear
stress, or external force. Fluids are a phase of matter and include
liquids, gases and plasmas. They are substances with zero or small
shear modulus, and flow at a perceptible rate under any shear force
applied to them. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid)

####  Gaseous material

[]{#gas}

Concept: [`gas`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/gas)

Child of:
 [`fluid`](#fluid)

independent shape nor volume but tends to expand indefinitely
(http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000797). Infer that the sample
is curated in some kind of container.

####  Liquid water

[]{#liquidwater}

Concept: [`liquidwater`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/liquidwater)

Child of:
 [`fluid`](#fluid)

A material primarily composed of dihydrogen oxide in its liquid form;
infer that the sample is curated in some kind of container.

####  Non-aqueous liquid material

[]{#nonaqueousliquid}

Concept: [`nonaqueousliquid`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/nonaqueousliquid)

Child of:
 [`fluid`](#fluid)

Liquid composed dominantly of material other than water. Includes
liquids that do not fit in any other category. E.g. alcohol,
petroleum.

###  Organic material

[]{#organicmaterial}

Concept: [`organicmaterial`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/organicmaterial)

Child of:
 [`material`](#material)

Material derived from living organisms and composed primarily of one
or more very large molecules of biological origin. Examples: body
(animal or plant), body part, fecal matter, seeds, wood, tissue,
biological fluids, biological waste, algal material, biofilm,
necromass, plankton. source:
