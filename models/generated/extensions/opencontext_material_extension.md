##  anthropogenic metal

[]{#anthropogenicmetal}

Concept: [`anthropogenicmetal`](https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/anthropogenicmetal)

Specimen is dominantly composed of metal that has been produced or
used by humans; subclass of anthropogenic material. Samples of
naturally occuring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold
nuggets) should be considered mineral material. Metallic material is
material that when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance,
and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are
typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile
(can be drawn into wires). The boundaries between metals, nonmetals,
and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally
accepted definitions of the categories involved.

processes.' (Nickel, Ernest H. (1995), The definition of a mineral,
The Canadian Mineralogist. 33 (3): 689–90). Include mineraloids. ... A

occurring, solid and stable at room temperature, representable by a
chemical formula, usually abiogenic, and that has an ordered atomic
structure. (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000256). Comment:
the identity of a mineral species is defined by a crystal structure
and a chemical composition that might include various specific
elemental substitutions in that structure. Mineraloid: A naturally
occurring mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate
crystallinity. Mineraloids possess chemical compositions that vary
beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals. Examples:
obsidian, Opal. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineraloid)

transparent cells are the cuticular scales. The portion of the hair
outside of the skin is called the shaft. Fine, closely spaced hair
