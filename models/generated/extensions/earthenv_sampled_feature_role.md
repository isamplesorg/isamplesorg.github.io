##  Sampled feature part

[]{#sampledfeaturepart}

Concept: [`sampledfeaturepart`](https://w3id.org/isample/earthenv/essampledfeatrole/sampledfeaturepart)

A sampled feature that is part of a larger sampled feature; Could be
improper part (e.g. the whole larger feature)

###  inclusion

[]{#inclusion}

Concept: [`inclusion`](https://w3id.org/isample/earthenv/essampledfeatrole/inclusion)

Child of:
 [`sampledfeaturepart`](#sampledfeaturepart)

sampled feature is an object contained within a larger body of
material.

####  clast

[]{#clast}

Concept: [`clast`](https://w3id.org/isample/earthenv/essampledfeatrole/clast)

Child of:
 [`inclusion`](#inclusion)

A clast is a fragment of rock or mineral derived from some pre-
existing rock or generated by intrabasinal processes that is a part of
a sediment

####  cognate inclusion

[]{#cognateinclusion}

Concept: [`cognateinclusion`](https://w3id.org/isample/earthenv/essampledfeatrole/cognateinclusion)

Child of:
 [`inclusion`](#inclusion)

An inclusion in an igneous rock that is interpreted to be genetically
related to the enclosing rock.

####  fluid inclusion

[]{#fluidinclusion}

Concept: [`fluidinclusion`](https://w3id.org/isample/earthenv/essampledfeatrole/fluidinclusion)

Child of:
 [`inclusion`](#inclusion)

an inclusion that is an opening in a mineral grain containing fluid
(liquid or gas).

####  melt inclusion

[]{#meltinclusion}

Concept: [`meltinclusion`](https://w3id.org/isample/earthenv/essampledfeatrole/meltinclusion)

Child of:
 [`inclusion`](#inclusion)

An inclusion in a mineral grain in an igneous rock that is interpreted
to consist of trapped magma from which the igneous rock was formed.

####  mineral inclusion

[]{#mineralinclusion}

Concept: [`mineralinclusion`](https://w3id.org/isample/earthenv/essampledfeatrole/mineralinclusion)

Child of:
 [`inclusion`](#inclusion)

An inclusion of a mineral phase contained inside a grain of another
mineral.

####  xenolith

[]{#xenolith}

Concept: [`xenolith`](https://w3id.org/isample/earthenv/essampledfeatrole/xenolith)

Child of:
 [`inclusion`](#inclusion)

An inclusion that is a fragment of pre-existing material that is
contained in an igneous rock and unrelated to the magma that formed
the rock.

###  individual constituent

[]{#individualconstituent}

Concept: [`individualconstituent`](https://w3id.org/isample/earthenv/essampledfeatrole/individualconstituent)

Child of:
 [`sampledfeaturepart`](#sampledfeaturepart)

sampled feature is a single particle or collection of particles that
share some characteristic, within or extracted from a larger sample.

####  cement

[]{#cement}

Concept: [`cement`](https://w3id.org/isample/earthenv/essampledfeatrole/cement)

Child of:
 [`individualconstituent`](#individualconstituent)

sampled feature is material that binds constituent particles together
in a sedimentary rock.

####  groundmass

[]{#groundmass}

Concept: [`groundmass`](https://w3id.org/isample/earthenv/essampledfeatrole/groundmass)

Child of:
 [`individualconstituent`](#individualconstituent)

sampled feature is fine-grained to aphanitic material that is
interstitial to larger crystals or particles in a sample.

####  phenocryst

[]{#phenocryst}

Concept: [`phenocryst`](https://w3id.org/isample/earthenv/essampledfeatrole/phenocryst)

Child of:
 [`individualconstituent`](#individualconstituent)

Sampled feature is a crystal that is significantly larger than
surrounding crystals in an igneous rock.

####  porphyroblast

[]{#porphyroblast}

Concept: [`porphyroblast`](https://w3id.org/isample/earthenv/essampledfeatrole/porphyroblast)

Child of:
 [`individualconstituent`](#individualconstituent)

Sampled feature is a crystal that is significantly larger than
surrounding crystals in a metamorphic rock.

###  rock body

[]{#rockbody}

Concept: [`rockbody`](https://w3id.org/isample/earthenv/essampledfeatrole/rockbody)

Child of:
 [`sampledfeaturepart`](#sampledfeaturepart)

sampled feature is representative of a rock body, i.e. it represents
the whole of the sampled body.
