title: Setup document editing
---

These documents are rendered using Quarto.

Some pages use the Jupyter kernel to fetch and render content on some pages, and so python and dependencies need to be installed.

1. Install quarto
2. Create python virtual envronment (to avoid polluting your global environment with dependencies)
3. Install dependencies
4. Install a python kernel named "isampled-quarto":
   ```
   python -m ipykernel install --name isamples-quarto
   ```
5. Render preview using `quarto preview` in the root folder of this repository.
