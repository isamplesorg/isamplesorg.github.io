Add Dublin core imports.  2022-03-11 SMR change definitions from rdfs:comment to skos:definition. Minor fixes in definitions. Add skos matches to URIs from other vocabularies.  2022-09-30 SMR per https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata/issues/109, change specimen to sample in vocabulary names and labels. Add ‘Slurry biome aggregation’ and ‘Bundle biome aggregation’ (github issue 110). Rename ‘liquid or gas’ sample type to ‘fluid in container’ (github issue 108).  2023-07-27 SMR modify base specimen type vocabulary, add ‘Non biologic solid object’ change broader relations in this vocab to use that as parent class where appropriate. Intention is a specimen category for solid objects that are not biologic; this subsumes ‘Fossil’ and ‘Artifact’, but excludes living organism, their parts and products. Obviously there is some overlap with Research specimens.  2023-11-06 SMR add missing inScheme on Non-biologic solid object and solid materal specimen. Update version number in URI to 1.0  2024-04-19 SMR update language to always use ‘material sample’ instead of specimen or physical specimen, including in text, labels, and in the URI tokens. Edit defintions to improve clarity.  2024-09-13 remove version numbers from URI\nConcept Hierarchy:"

There are three core vocabularies for different aspects of sample type: material sample type, material type, and sampled feature type. Each vocabulary is maintained as an RDF file using the SKOS vocabulary, with hierarchical relationships using SKOS:broader. In order to be domain agnostic, these core taxonomies cover a small set of top level terms. The taxonomies may be extended as necessary to support more specialized domains by relating additional terms using SKOS:broader and SKOS:narrower.\nThe iSamples core taxonomies are controlled vocabularies with terms related by SKOS:broader and SKOS:narrower.

Unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes, bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles. Molecular systematics showed prokaryotic life to consist of two separate domains, originally called Eubacteria and Archaebacteria, but now called Bacteria and Archaea that evolved independently from an ancient common ancestor. Almost all prokaryotes have a cell wall, a protective structure that allows them to survive in extreme conditions, which is located outside of their plasma membrane.

Make Experiment setting and Laboratory or curatorial environment subclasses of Active human occupation site.  2021-12-10 SMR add missing skos:inScheme statements  2022-01-07 SMR change to https://w3id.org/isample/ uri base, make the ConceptScheme an ontology as well. For uploading to ESIP COR and w3id resolution redirect set up. Add some mappings to other ontologies using seeAlso, closeMatch, narrowMatch.  2022-03-11 SMR change definitions from rdfs:comment to skos:definition. Minor fixes in definitions. Add skos matches to URIs from other vocabularies. Fix typo in glacierenvrionment URI (changed the URI to glacierenvironment)  2022-09-07 SMR update some of the skos mappings to other vocabularies; remove references to other vocabularies as NamedIndividual. Remove rocksample class, it was not linked in hierarchy and inconsistent with design.  2022-09-30 add biological entity as sampled feature, per issue https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata/issues/107. This update was lost at some point and added back in 2022-12-09.  2023-11-05 SMR update version to 1.0, prep for release  2024-04-19 SMR update definitions to remove use of ‘specimen’.

The problem is: - Running expensive aggregations on EVERY page load (fixable with Strategy A) - No indexes on array-valued columns (list_contains scans) (fixable with Strategy C) - No query result caching (fixable with client-side storage)"

This requires traversing the graph through edges:\n\n\nCode\n// Example: Get samples with direct location assignments (CORRECTED)\n// Path: Sample -&gt; produced_by -&gt; SamplingEvent -&gt; sample_location -&gt; GeospatialCoordLocation\nsampleLocationExample = {\n    const query = `\n        WITH sample_locations AS (\n            SELECT\n                s.pid as sample_id,\n                s.label as sample_label,\n                g.latitude,\n                g.longitude,\n                'direct_event_location' as location_relationship\n            FROM nodes s\n            JOIN nodes e1 ON s.row_id = e1.s AND e1.p = 'produced_by'\n            JOIN nodes event ON e1.o[1] = event.row_id\n            JOIN nodes e2 ON event.row_id = e2.s AND e2.p = 'sample_location'\n            JOIN nodes g ON e2.o[1] = g.row_id\n            WHERE s.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'\n              AND event.otype = 'SamplingEvent'\n              AND g.otype = 'GeospatialCoordLocation'\n              AND g.latitude IS NOT NULL\n            LIMIT 5\n        )\n        SELECT * FROM sample_locations\n    `;\n    const data = await loadData(query, [], \"loading_sample_loc_example\");\n    return data;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading example…\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof sampleLocationTable = Inputs.table(sampleLocationExample, {\n    layout: \"auto\"\n})\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2 ⚠️ Why Previous Queries Failed\nMany existing examples tried this incorrect pattern:\n-- ❌ BROKEN: This relationship doesn't exist!\nFROM MaterialSampleRecord s\nJOIN edge e ON s.row_id = e.s AND e.p = 'sample_location'\nJOIN GeospatialCoordLocation g ON e.o[1] = g.row_id\nResult: 0 samples found\nThe correct pattern requires going through SamplingEvent:\n-- ✅ CORRECT: Multi-hop traversal\nFROM MaterialSampleRecord s\nJOIN edge e1 ON s.row_id = e1.s AND e1.p = 'produced_by'\nJOIN SamplingEvent event ON e1.o[1] = event.row_id\nJOIN edge e2 ON event.row_id = e2.s AND e2.p = 'sample_location'\nJOIN GeospatialCoordLocation g ON e2.o[1] = g.row_id\nResult: 1,096,274 samples found!\n\n\n5.3 Multi-Hop Traversal: Sample → Event → Site → Location\nMany samples don’t have direct coordinates but are linked through their collection event and site:\n\n\nCode\n// Trace the full chain from sample to site location\nsiteChainExample = {\n    const query = `\n        SELECT\n            samp.pid as sample_id,\n            event.pid as event_id,\n            site.label as site_name,\n            loc.latitude,\n            loc.longitude\n        FROM nodes samp\n        JOIN nodes e1 ON samp.row_id = e1.s AND e1.p = 'produced_by'\n        JOIN nodes event ON e1.o[1] = event.row_id\n        JOIN nodes e2 ON event.row_id = e2.s AND e2.p = 'sampling_site'\n        JOIN nodes site ON e2.o[1] = site.row_id\n        JOIN nodes e3 ON site.row_id = e3.s AND e3.p = 'site_location'\n        JOIN nodes loc ON e3.o[1] = loc.row_id\n        WHERE samp.otype = 'MaterialSampleRecord'\n          AND event.otype = 'SamplingEvent'\n          AND site.otype = 'SamplingSite'\n          AND loc.otype = 'GeospatialCoordLocation'\n        LIMIT 5\n    `;\n    const data = await loadData(query, [], \"loading_chain_example\");\n    return data;\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading traversal example…\n\n\n\nCode\nviewof siteChainTable = Inputs.table(siteChainExample, {\n    layout: \"auto\",\n    width: {\n        sample_id: 150,\n        event_id: 150,\n        site_name: 200\n    }\n})"

Samples that reach this location only through their site’s p__site_location (SITE_LOCATION) are not included. This means site marker locations may return 0 results if no events were recorded at that exact coordinate.\n\nsamples_combined = selectedSamplesCombined\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nhtml`${\n  combinedLoading ?\n    html`&lt;div class=\"loading\"&gt;Loading samples…&lt;/div&gt;`\n  :\n  samples_combined && samples_combined.length &gt; 0 ?\n    html`&lt;div style=\"max-height: 600px; overflow-y: auto; border: 1px solid #ddd; border-radius: 4px;\"&gt;\n      &lt;table style=\"width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 0.9em;\"&gt;\n        &lt;thead style=\"position: sticky; top: 0; background: #f8f9fa; z-index: 1;\"&gt;\n          &lt;tr style=\"border-bottom: 2px solid #dee2e6;\"&gt;\n            &lt;th style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left;\"&gt;Thumbnail&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;th style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left;\"&gt;Sample&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;th style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left;\"&gt;Description&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;th style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left;\"&gt;Site&lt;/th&gt;\n            &lt;th style=\"padding: 12px; text-align: left;\"&gt;Location&lt;/th&gt;\n          &lt;/tr&gt;\n        &lt;/thead&gt;\n        &lt;tbody&gt;\n          ${samples_combined.map((sample, i) =&gt; html`\n            &lt;tr style=\"border-bottom: 1px solid #eee; ${i % 2 === 0 ?

Samples with only one traversal will be excluded.\n\n\n3.3 Full Relationship Map Using Typed Edges (Wide Format)\n                                    Agent\n                                      ↑\n                                      | p__responsibility, p__registrant\n                                      |\nMaterialSampleRecord ─p__produced_by─→ SamplingEvent ─p__sample_location─→ GeospatialCoordLocation\n    |                                       |                                         ↑\n    |                                       |                                         |\n    | p__keywords,                          └─p__sampling_site─→ SamplingSite ─p__site_location─┘\n    | p__has_sample_object_type,\n    | p__has_material_category\n    |\n    └──→ IdentifiedConcept\nEdge Categories (Wide Format Columns): - DIRECT LOCATION: p__produced_by → p__sample_location - SITE-MEDIATED LOCATION: p__produced_by → p__sampling_site → p__site_location - AGENT EDGES: p__registrant, p__responsibility - CONCEPT EDGES: p__keywords, p__has_*_category, p__has_sample_object_type\nKey Insight: SamplingEvent is the central hub for most relationships, except concept edges which attach directly to MaterialSampleRecord.\n\n\n3.4 Query Pattern Analysis (Wide Format)\nThe following analysis shows Eric’s query functions in wide format:\n\n3.4.1 1. get_sample_data_via_sample_pid - Uses BOTH Location Traversals\nMaterialSampleRecord (WHERE pid = ?)\n  → p__produced_by → SamplingEvent\n    ├─→ p__sample_location → GeospatialCoordLocation [Direct]\n    └─→ p__sampling_site → SamplingSite [Site-Mediated]\n\nReturns: sample metadata + lat/lon + site label/pid\nRequired: BOTH traversals must exist (INNER JOIN)\n\n\n3.4.2 2. get_sample_data_agents_sample_pid - Uses Agent Edges\nMaterialSampleRecord (WHERE pid = ?)\n  → p__produced_by → SamplingEvent\n    → p__responsibility → Agent\n\nReturns: sample metadata + agent info (who collected/registered)\nIndependent of: Location traversals (no geographic data)\n\n\n3.4.3 3. get_sample_types_and_keywords_via_sample_pid - Uses Concept Edges\nMaterialSampleRecord (WHERE pid = ?)\n  → p__keywords → IdentifiedConcept\n  → p__has_sample_object_type → IdentifiedConcept\n  → p__has_material_category → IdentifiedConcept\n\nReturns: sample metadata + classification keywords/types\nIndependent of: Location traversals and SamplingEvent!\n\n\n3.4.4 4. get_samples_at_geo_cord_location_via_sample_event - Eric’s Canonical Query\nGeospatialCoordLocation (WHERE pid = ?)  ← START HERE (reverse!)\n  ← p__sample_location ← SamplingEvent [Direct, reversed]\n    ├─→ p__sampling_site → SamplingSite [Site context - provenance!]\n    └─← p__produced_by ← MaterialSampleRecord [complete chain]\n\nReturns: all samples at a given location + site info\nDirection: geo → samples (opposite of other queries)\nKey Insight (from Eric Kansa): This canonical query requires BOTH p__sample_location AND p__sampling_site - it’s not just “find samples at this location” but “find samples at this location that have proper site provenance.”\nSummary Table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\nDirect Location\nSite-Mediated\nDirection\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nget_sample_data_via_sample_pid\n✅ Required\n✅ Required\nForward\nINNER JOIN - no row if either missing\n\n\nget_sample_data_agents_sample_pid\n❌ N/A\n❌ N/A\nN/A\nUses agent edges instead\n\n\nget_sample_types_and_keywords_via_sample_pid\n❌ N/A\n❌ N/A\nN/A\nDirect concept edges\n\n\nget_samples_at_geo_cord_location_via_sample_event\n✅ Required\n✅ Required\nReverse\nGeo → samples with site provenance",

    "text": "6 Geographic Location Classification\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip✅ IMPLEMENTED - Differentiated Geographic Visualization\n\n\n\nCurrent implementation: GeospatialCoordLocations are now color-coded by their semantic role in the property graph:\n\n🔵 Blue (small) - sample_location_only: Precise field collection points (EVENT_SAMPLE_LOCATION)\n🟣 Purple (large) - site_location_only: Administrative site markers (SITE_LOCATION)\n🟠 Orange (medium) - both: Dual-purpose locations (used for both direct and site-mediated location)\n\nDiscovery: Analysis of the OpenContext parquet data reveals that geos fall into three distinct categories based on their usage:\n\nsample_location_only: Precise field collection points (EVENT_SAMPLE_LOCATION)\n\nMost common category\nRepresents exact GPS coordinates where sampling events occurred\nVaries per event, even within the same site\n\nsite_location_only: Administrative site markers (SITE_LOCATION)\n\nRepresents general/reference locations for named archaeological sites\nOne coordinate per site\nMay not correspond to any actual collection point\n\nboth: 10,346 geos (5.2%) - Dual-purpose locations\n\nUsed as BOTH p__sample_location AND p__site_location\nPrimarily single-location sites (85% of all sites)\nOccasionally one of many locations at multi-location sites (e.g., PKAP)\n\n\nSite spatial patterns: - 85.4% of sites are compact (single location) - all events at one coordinate - Example: Suberde - 384 events at one location - 14.6% of sites are distributed (multiple locations) - events spread across space - Example: PKAP Survey Area - 15,446 events across 544 different coordinates - Poggio Civitate - 29,985 events across 11,112 coordinates\n\n6.1 Benefits of Current Implementation\n\nEducational: Makes EVENT_SAMPLE_LOCATION vs SITE_LOCATION distinction visually concrete\n\nUsers can SEE the semantic difference between precise and administrative locations\nBlue points show where samples were actually collected (EVENT_SAMPLE_LOCATION)\nPurple points show administrative site markers (SITE_LOCATION)\nDemonstrates the complementary nature of the two geographic paths\n\nExploratory: Enables visual understanding of spatial patterns\n\nArchaeological sites appear as purple markers (large points)\nField collection points appear as blue markers (small points)\nDual-purpose locations appear as orange markers (medium points)\nNo UI filters required - the colors provide immediate visual differentiation\n\nAnalytical: Reveals site spatial structure at a glance\n\nCompact sites: tight cluster of blue points around purple marker\nSurvey areas: purple marker with cloud of blue points spread across region\nIdentifies sampling strategies and field methodologies by visual inspection\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Wide Format Advantage\nThe classification query is simpler in wide format because it directly checks p__sample_location and p__site_location columns instead of querying through edge rows.\nNarrow format (edge rows):\nJOIN nodes e ON (geo.row_id = e.o[1])\nWHERE e.p IN ('sample_location', 'site_location')\nWide format (direct columns):\nLEFT JOIN nodes AS se ON (list_contains(se.p__sample_location, geo.row_id))\nLEFT JOIN nodes AS site ON (list_contains(site.p__site_location, geo.row_id))\n\n\n6.3 Implementation Status\nStatus: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Basic color-coding by location type)\nWhat’s implemented: - ✅ Classification query using p__sample_location and p__site_location columns - ✅ Conditional styling by location_type - ✅ Color-coded points: Blue (sample_location), Purple (site_location), Orange (both) - ✅ Size differentiation: 3px (field points), 6px (sites), 5px (dual-purpose)\nFuture enhancements (not yet implemented): - ⬜ UI filter controls (checkbox toggles for each location type) - ⬜ Site Explorer Mode (click site → highlight all sample_locations) - ⬜ Convex hull/region drawing for distributed sites - ⬜ Dynamic statistics display on site selection\nThis implementation transforms the visualization from uniform points into a pedagogical tool that visually demonstrates the EVENT_SAMPLE_LOCATION vs SITE_LOCATION distinction in the iSamples metadata model architecture.",

    "text": "6 Geographic Location Classification\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip✅ IMPLEMENTED - Differentiated Geographic Visualization\n\n\n\nCurrent implementation: GeospatialCoordLocations are now color-coded by their semantic role in the property graph:\n\n🔵 Blue (small) - sample_location_only: Precise field collection points (via EVENT_SAMPLE_LOCATION)\n🟣 Purple (large) - site_location_only: Administrative site markers (via SITE_LOCATION)\n🟠 Orange (medium) - both: Dual-purpose locations (used by both edge types)\n\nDiscovery: Analysis of the OpenContext parquet data reveals that geos fall into three distinct categories based on their usage:\n\nsample_location_only: Precise field collection points (via EVENT_SAMPLE_LOCATION)\n\nMost common category\nRepresents exact GPS coordinates where sampling events occurred\nVaries per event, even within the same site\n\nsite_location_only: Administrative site markers (via SITE_LOCATION)\n\nRepresents general/reference locations for named archaeological sites\nOne coordinate per site\nMay not correspond to any actual collection point\n\nboth: 10,346 geos (5.2%) - Dual-purpose locations\n\nUsed by BOTH EVENT_SAMPLE_LOCATION AND SITE_LOCATION edges\nPrimarily single-location sites (85% of all sites)\nOccasionally one of many locations at multi-location sites (e.g., PKAP)\n\n\nSite spatial patterns: - 85.4% of sites are compact (single location) - all events at one coordinate - Example: Suberde - 384 events at one location - 14.6% of sites are distributed (multiple locations) - events spread across space - Example: PKAP Survey Area - 15,446 events across 544 different coordinates - Poggio Civitate - 29,985 events across 11,112 coordinates\n\n6.1 Benefits of Current Implementation\n\nEducational: Makes direct vs site-mediated location distinction visually concrete\n\nUsers can SEE the semantic difference between precise and administrative locations\nBlue points show where samples were actually collected (EVENT_SAMPLE_LOCATION)\nPurple points show administrative site markers (SITE_LOCATION)\nDemonstrates the complementary nature of the two location edge types\n\nExploratory: Enables visual understanding of spatial patterns\n\nArchaeological sites appear as purple markers (large points)\nField collection points appear as blue markers (small points)\nDual-purpose locations appear as orange markers (medium points)\nNo UI filters required - the colors provide immediate visual differentiation\n\nAnalytical: Reveals site spatial structure at a glance\n\nCompact sites: tight cluster of blue points around purple marker\nSurvey areas: purple marker with cloud of blue points spread across region\nIdentifies sampling strategies and field methodologies by visual inspection\n\n\n\n\n6.2 Advanced Features (Future)\nSite Explorer Mode: - Click a site_location (purple marker) → reveal all its sample_locations (blue points) - Draw convex hull or region around the site’s collection points - Display site statistics: event count, spatial extent, temporal range\nExample interaction:\nUser clicks PKAP Survey Area marker (purple)\n→ Highlights 544 blue sample_location points within the survey area\n→ Shows: \"15,446 events across 544 locations (0.7% at site marker, 99.3% elsewhere)\"\n→ Draws polygon boundary around the survey extent\n\n\n6.3 Implementation Status\nStatus: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Basic color-coding by location type)\nWhat’s implemented: - ✅ Classification query with CTE (lines 123-146) - ✅ Conditional styling by location_type (lines 153-166) - ✅ Color-coded points: Blue (sample_location), Purple (site_location), Orange (both) - ✅ Size differentiation: 3px (field points), 6px (sites), 5px (dual-purpose)\nPerformance impact: - Query execution time increased slightly due to JOIN and GROUP BY - Same 198k points rendered, now with semantic color coding - No noticeable performance degradation in browser rendering\nFuture enhancements (not yet implemented): - ⬜ UI filter controls (checkbox toggles for each location type) - ⬜ Site Explorer Mode (click site → highlight all sample_locations) - ⬜ Convex hull/region drawing for distributed sites - ⬜ Dynamic statistics display on site selection\nThis implementation transforms the visualization from uniform points into a pedagogical tool that visually demonstrates the EVENT_SAMPLE_LOCATION vs SITE_LOCATION distinction in the iSamples typed edge model.",
