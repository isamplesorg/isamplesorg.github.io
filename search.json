    "text": "Namespaces are used to uniquely address resources offered by the project.\nIn order to support introspection, all namespace IRIs are to be resolvable. Resolution involves three variables: the IRI, the requested content type, and an optional profile.\nThe IRI provides the location of the resource. Reference to specific items within a resource can be made in two ways: by path (e.g. /resource/element) and by fragment (e.g. resource#element). IRI fragments are not transmitted to a server by a client, hence a fragment identifier is always relative to the retrieved document. The basic rule is thus, the path element reference is used to reference a specific document, then a fragment is used to reference a specific component of the document.\nThe requested content type is presented by a client in the Accept header. If no Accept header is presented by the client or the Accept header is ambiguous (e.g. */*), then the default content type is returned. If a specific content type can not be matched, then a 406 Not Acceptable status is returned.\n\n\n\nIRI\n\nhttps://w3id.org/isamples/\n\n\nThe namespace base provides the root for project IRIs.

Add Dublin core imports.  2022-03-11 SMR change definitions from rdfs:comment to skos:definition. Minor fixes in definitions. Add skos matches to URIs from other vocabularies.  2022-09-30 SMR per https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata/issues/109, change specimen to sample in vocabulary names and labels. Add ‘Slurry biome aggregation’ and ‘Bundle biome aggregation’ (github issue 110). Rename ‘liquid or gas’ sample type to ‘fluid in container’ (github issue 108).  2023-07-27 SMR modify base specimen type vocabulary, add ‘Non biologic solid object’ change broader relations in this vocab to use that as parent class where appropriate. Intention is a specimen category for solid objects that are not biologic; this subsumes ‘Fossil’ and ‘Artifact’, but excludes living organism, their parts and products. Obviously there is some overlap with Research specimens.  2023-11-06 SMR add missing inScheme on Non-biologic solid object and solid materal specimen. Update version number in URI to 1.0  2024-04-19 SMR update language to always use ‘material sample’ instead of specimen or physical specimen, including in text, labels, and in the URI tokens. Edit defintions to improve clarity.\nConcept Hierarchy:"

Samples of naturally occuring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold nuggets) should be considered mineral material. Metallic material is material that when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). The boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved.

Cells have several types of internal enclosed compartments. Cell walls, if present, are made from cellulose or chitin, in contrast to prokaryotes. Eukaryotes have novel modes of direct body movement and swimming, based on sensors, and the mode of reproduction uses sexual combination. Their DNA is linear but wound up into nucleosomes and then chromosomes. (https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-044452115-6/50050-6, table 7-2).

The Mycetozoa can be further subdivided into two groups: the plasmodial slime molds and the cellular slime molds. Myxomycetes has most child orders; they are class of slime molds. Myxomycetes have a complex life cycle involving the formation of spore-bearing structures called fruiting bodies, which is a key feature that distinguishes them from other amoebae. All species pass through several, very different morphologic phases, such as microscopic individual cells, slimy amorphous organisms visible with the naked eye and conspicuously shaped fruit bodies.

Unlike cells of animals and other eukaryotes, bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles. Molecular systematics showed prokaryotic life to consist of two separate domains, originally called Eubacteria and Archaebacteria, but now called Bacteria and Archaea that evolved independently from an ancient common ancestor. Almost all prokaryotes have a cell wall, a protective structure that allows them to survive in extreme conditions, which is located outside of their plasma membrane.

(https://quizlet.com/234154298/archaea-and-bacteria-flash-cards/). The common characteristics of Archaebacteria known to date are these: (1) the presence of characteristic tRNAs and ribosomal RNAs; (2) the absence of peptidoglycan cell walls, with in many cases, replacement by a largely proteinaceous coat; (3) the occurrence of ether linked lipids built from phytanyl chains and (4) in all cases known so far, their occurrence only in unusual habitats.

Bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles. The bacterial cell is surrounded by a cell membrane, which is made primarily of phospholipids. This membrane encloses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients, proteins and other essential components of the cytoplasm within the cell. Bacterial cell walls are composed of peptidoglycan, a complex of protein and sugars, while archaeal cell walls are composed of polysaccharides (sugars).

    "text": "1 Project Objectives\n\nDesign and develop iSamples infrastructure (iSamples in a Box and iSamples Central);\nBuild four initial implementations of iSamples for adoption and use case testing (Open Context, GEOME, SESAR, and Smithsonian Institution);\nConduct outreach and community engagement to developers, individual researchers, and international organizations concerned with material samples.\n\n\n\n\niSamples diagram\n\n\n\n\n2 Background\nResearch frequently uses material samples as a basic element for reference, study, and experimentation in many scientific disciplines, especially in the natural and environmental sciences, material sciences, agriculture, physical anthropology, archaeology, and biomedicine. Observations made on samples collected in the field and in the laboratory constitute a critical data resource for research that addresses grand challenges of our planet’s future sustainability, from environmental change; to food, energy, and water resources; to natural hazards and their mitigation; to public health. The large investments of public funds being made to curate huge volumes of samples acquired over decades or even centuries, and to collect and analyze new samples demand these samples to be openly accessible, easily discoverable, and documented with sufficient information to make them reusable. The current ecosystem of sample and sample data management in the U.S. and globally is highly fragmented across stakeholders, including museums, federal agencies, academic institutions, and individual researchers, with a multitude of institutional and discipline-specific catalogs, practices for sample identification, and protocols for describing samples.\nThe iSamples project is a multi-disciplinary collaboration that will develop a national digital infrastructure that will provide services for globally unique, consistent, and convenient identification of material samples; metadata about them; and linking them to other samples, derived data, and research results published in the literature. iSamples builds on previous initiatives to achieve this by providing material samples with globally unique, persistent identifiers that reliably link to landing pages with metadata describing the sample and its provenance, and which allow unambiguously linking samples with data and publications.\nLeveraging significant national investments, iSamples provides the missing link among:\n\nphysical collections (e.g., natural history museums, herbaria, biobanks),\nfield stations, marine laboratories, long-term ecological research sites, and observatories, and\ndata repositories and cyberinfrastructure. iSamples delivers enhanced infrastructure for STEM research and education, decision-makers, and the general public.\n\niSamples benefits national security and resource management by offering a means to assure sample provenance, improving scientific reproducibility and demonstrating compliance with ethical standards, national regulations, and international treaties, (e.g., automated audits of sensitive archaeological specimens, endangered species, or specimens containing controlled substances).\n\n\n3 Technical perspective\nThe iSamples project will:\n\nCreate a flexible and scalable architecture to ensure broad adoption and implementation by diverse stakeholders.\nBuild upon on existing identifier infrastructure such as IGSNs (Global Sample Number;) and ARKs (Archival Resource Keys), but is agnostic to identifier type.\nEncourage a high-level metadata standard for natural history samples (across biosciences, geosciences, and archaeology), while supporting community-developed metadata standards in specialist domains.\nExtend existing capabilities, enhance consistency, and expand their reach to serve science and society much more broadly through integration with established discipline-specific infrastructure at the System for Earth Sample Registration SESAR (geoscience), CyVerse (bioscience), Open Context (archaeology), and the Smithsonian Institution.\n\n\n\n4 Principal Investigators\n\nKerstin Lehnert, Columbia University\nAndrea Thomer, University of Arizona\nNeil Davies, The Regents of the University of California, Berkeley\nDavid Vieglais, University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute",

Samples of naturally occurring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold nuggets) should be considered mineral material. Metallic material is material that when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). The boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved.

The identity of a mineral species is defined by a crystal structure and a chemical composition that might include various specific elemental substitutions in that structure. Mineraloid: A naturally occurring mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate crystallinity. Mineraloids possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals. Examples: obsidian, Opal.

ENVO definition (ENVO_01000060) has “composed of microscopic portions of solid or liquid material suspended in another environmental material.” Refine here to define as the solid particles, distinct from a material in which they are suspended. A material that includes solid or liquid particles suspended in another material would be a dispersed_media in this scheme, not defined in ENVO. Human manufactured particulates (e.g. rock powder) should be categorized as ‘Anthropogenic material’ as well as ‘Particulate’\n\n\n1.5.4 Rock or sediment\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/1.0/rockorsediment  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/1.0/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Natural Solid Material-&gt;Rock or sediment\nImmediately narrower concepts: Rock, Sediment\nDefinition:  Material is rock or sediment. For example core from boreholes that likely penetrate sediment near the surface and rock at greater depth, with descriptions that do not clearly distinguish non-consolidated sediment from rock.\nNotes:  Use for samples described as rock&gt;sedimentary AND sediment, where it is unclear whether the sample is a consolidated ‘rock’ object, or loose disaggregated material in a bag.\nUse for samples like dredge hauls and ROV scoops that mix rock and sediment from a water body bottom.\nDistinct from ‘Mixed soil, sediment or rock’ that represents samples known to have components of all these materials.\n\n1.5.4.1 Rock\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/1.0/rock  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/1.0/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Natural Solid Material-&gt;Rock or sediment-&gt;Rock\nDefinition:  Consolidated aggregate of particles (grains) of rock, mineral (including native elements), mineraloid, or solid organic material.

Particles might be derived by erosion of pre-existing rock, from shell or other body parts from organisms, precipitated chemically in the surficial environment, or generated by explosive volcanic activity. (http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/sediment). Sediment is not consolidated, i.e. the particulate constituents do not adhere to each other strongly enough that the aggregate can be considered a solid material in its own right. Similar to http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00002007\nNotes:  Note that this category includes chemical sediments that might preciptate to form a solid mass, e.g. preciptitates forming vents at submarine hot springs, or gypsum and halite deposites formed by evaporation in hypersaline lakes.
