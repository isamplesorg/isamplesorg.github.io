    "text": "Namespaces are used to uniquely address resources offered by the project.\nIn order to support introspection, all namespace IRIs are to be resolvable. Resolution involves three variables: the IRI, the requested content type, and an optional profile.\nThe IRI provides the location of the resource. Reference to specific items within a resource can be made in two ways: by path (e.g. /resource/element) and by fragment (e.g. resource#element). IRI fragments are not transmitted to a server by a client, hence a fragment identifier is always relative to the retrieved document. The basic rule is thus, the path element reference is used to reference a specific document, then a fragment is used to reference a specific component of the document.\nThe requested content type is presented by a client in the Accept header. If no Accept header is presented by the client or the Accept header is ambiguous (e.g. */*), then the default content type is returned. If a specific content type can not be matched, then a 406 Not Acceptable status is returned.\n\n\n\nIRI\n\nhttps://w3id.org/isamples/\n\n\nThe namespace base provides the root for project IRIs. The project will utilize the w3id.org infrastructure to enable abstraction of the advertised location and the physical location of the resource. Such abstraction is especially important early in the project as locations of resources are in flux.\n\n\n\nThe default format for definitions is JSON-LD.

This standard is also known as normal temperature and pressure (NTP).\nSamples of non-aqueous ice should be classified as ‘Any ice’, based on decision that distinguishing ‘ice that might or might not be aqueous’ from ‘non-aqueous ice’ does not merit adding another class to the scheme.\n\n1.2.1 Frozen water\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/waterice  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Any ice-&gt;Frozen water\nDefinition:  Water that is in a solid state.\nAlternate labels:  Water ice\n\n\n\n1.3 Biogenic non-organic material\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/biogenicnonorganicmaterial  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Biogenic non-organic material\nDefinition:  Material produced by an organism but not composed of ‘very large molecules of biological origin.’ E.g. bone, tooth, shell, coral skeleton,\n\n\n1.4 Dispersed media\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/dispersedmedia  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Dispersed media\nDefinition:  Material that contains discrete elements of some material dispersed in a continuous fluid medium. The dispersed component can be a gas, a liquid or a solid (based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersed_media).

(1995), The definition of a mineral, The Canadian Mineralogist. 33 (3): 689–90). Include mineraloids. … A material primarily composed of some substance that is naturally occurring, solid and stable at room temperature, representable by a chemical formula, usually abiogenic, and that has an ordered atomic structure. (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000256). The identity of a mineral species is defined by a crystal structure and a chemical composition that might include various specific elemental substitutions in that structure. Mineraloid: A naturally occurring mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate crystallinity. Mineraloids possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals. Examples: obsidian, Opal. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineraloid)\n\n\n1.5.2 Mixed soil sediment or rock\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/mixedsoilsedimentrock  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Natural Solid Material-&gt;Mixed soil sediment or rock\nDefinition:  Material is mixed aggregation of fragments of undifferentiated soil, sediment or rock origin. e.g. cuttings from some boreholes (rock fragments and caved soil or sediment).\n\n\n1.5.3 Particulate\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/particulate  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Natural Solid Material-&gt;Particulate\nDefinition:  Material consists of microscopic particulate material derived by precipitation, filtering, or settling from suspension in a fluid, e.g. filtrate from water, deposition from atmosphere, astro material particles. Might include mineral, organic, or biological material. ENVO definition (ENVO_01000060) has “composed of microscopic portions of solid or liquid material suspended in another environmental material.” Refine here to define as the solid particles, distinct from a material in which they are suspended. A material that includes solid or liquid particles suspended in another material would be a dispersed_media in this scheme, not defined in ENVO. Human manufactured particulates (e.g. rock powder) should be categorized as ‘Anthropogenic material’ as well as ‘Particulate’\n\n\n1.5.4 Rock or sediment\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/rockorsediment  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Natural Solid Material-&gt;Rock or sediment\nImmediately narrower concepts: Rock, Sediment\nDefinition:  Material is rock or sediment. For example core from boreholes that likely penetrate sediment near the surface and rock at greater depth, with descriptions that do not clearly distinguish non-consolidated sediment from rock.\nNotes:  Use for samples described as rock&gt;sedimentary AND sediment, where it is unclear whether the sample is a consolidated ‘rock’ object, or loose disaggregated material in a bag.\nUse for samples like dredge hauls and ROV scoops that mix rock and sediment from a water body bottom.\nDistinct from ‘Mixed soil, sediment or rock’ that represents samples known to have components of all these materials.\n\n1.5.4.1 Rock\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/rock  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Natural Solid Material-&gt;Rock or sediment-&gt;Rock\nDefinition:  Consolidated aggregate of particles (grains) of rock, mineral (including native elements), mineraloid, or solid organic material. Includes mineral aggregates such as granite, shale, marble; natural glass such as obsidian; organic material formed by geologic processes such a coal; extraterrestrial material in meteorites; and crushed rock fragments like drill cuttings from rock. (based on http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/rock, same as http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00001995)\n\n\n1.5.4.2 Sediment\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/sediment  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Natural Solid Material-&gt;Rock or sediment-&gt;Sediment\nDefinition:  Solid granular material transported by wind, water, or gravity, not modified by interaction with biosphere or atmosphere (to differentiate from soil). Particles might be derived by erosion of pre-existing rock, from shell or other body parts from organisms, precipitated chemically in the surficial environment, or generated by explosive volcanic activity. (http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/sediment). Sediment is not consolidated, i.e. the particulate constituents do not adhere to each other strongly enough that the aggregate can be considered a solid material in its own right. Similar to http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00002007\nNotes:  Note that this category includes chemical sediments that might preciptate to form a solid mass, e.g. preciptitates forming vents at submarine hot springs, or gypsum and halite deposites formed by evaporation in hypersaline lakes. (http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/consolidationdegree/consolidated).\nTephra is subclass of sediment because it is generally not lithified, in which case it would be considered Rock.\n\n\n\n1.5.5 Soil\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/soil  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Natural Solid Material-&gt;Soil\nDefinition:  Mixed granular mineral and organic matter modified by interaction between earth material, biosphere, and atmosphere, consisting of varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil) Soil consists of horizons near the Earth’s surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time.

Molecular systematics showed prokaryotic life to consist of two separate domains, originally called Eubacteria and Archaebacteria, but now called Bacteria and Archaea that evolved independently from an ancient common ancestor. Almost all prokaryotes have a cell wall, a protective structure that allows them to survive in extreme conditions, which is located outside of their plasma membrane. Archaea and bacteria cannot reproduce sexually.\nAlternate labels:  Monera, SUPERKINGDOM PROKARYOTA (Ruggerio et al, 2015)\n\n1.4.1 Archaea\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/biology/biosampledfeature/archaea  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/biology/biosampledfeature/biologicentityvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Biological entity-&gt;Prokaryote-&gt;Archaea\nDefinition:  archaeal cell walls are composed of polysaccharides (sugars). they never have peptidoglycan in their cell walls, their cell membranes contain lipids of unique composition (glycerol molecules are mirror images of those found in other cells, and form ether linkages to isoprenoid side chains), and their 16S ribosomal- RNA nucleotide sequences are unlike those of bacteria. (https://quizlet.com/234154298/archaea-and-bacteria-flash-cards/). The common characteristics of Archaebacteria known to date are these: (1) the presence of characteristic tRNAs and ribosomal RNAs; (2) the absence of peptidoglycan cell walls, with in many cases, replacement by a largely proteinaceous coat; (3) the occurrence of ether linked lipids built from phytanyl chains and (4) in all cases known so far, their occurrence only in unusual habitats.

Bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles. The bacterial cell is surrounded by a cell membrane, which is made primarily of phospholipids. This membrane encloses the contents of the cell and acts as a barrier to hold nutrients, proteins and other essential components of the cytoplasm within the cell. Bacterial cell walls are composed of peptidoglycan, a complex of protein and sugars, while archaeal cell walls are composed of polysaccharides (sugars).

Bacteriophages are composed of proteins that encapsulate a DNA or RNA genome, and may have structures that are either simple or elaborate. Their genomes may encode as few as four genes (e.g. MS2) and as many as hundreds of genes. Phages replicate within the bacterium following the injection of their genome into its cytoplasm. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacteriophage). Includes all virus in order Caudovirales (e.g., bacteriophage T4, lambda phage).\nAlternate labels:  bacteriophage"

    "section": "",
    "text": "One key development of the iSamples project centers on the demonstration of low-cost, simplified, and more sustainable approaches to access, analyze and visualize scientific data. Rather than relying upon elaborate and costly server-side infrastructure, iSamples demonstrates how open source technologies like parquet and DuckDB-WASM can streamline cheaper and faster approaches to interacting with geospatial data.\nThis page demonstrates how geospatial data can be dynamically accessed from a remote parquet file in cloud storage.

    "text": "2 Introduction\nThis tutorial demonstrates how to efficiently analyze large geospatial datasets directly in your browser without downloading entire files. We’ll use DuckDB-WASM and Observable JS to perform fast, memory-efficient analysis and create interactive visualizations.\nNote: This tutorial attempts to connect to the live iSamples dataset (~300MB, 6+ million records). If CORS restrictions prevent access to the remote file, it automatically falls back to a representative demo dataset that demonstrates the same analytical techniques.\n\n2.1 Key Technologies\n\nDuckDB-WASM: In-browser analytical database with HTTP range request support\nObservable Plot: Grammar of graphics for interactive visualizations\nObservable Inputs: Interactive controls for data exploration\nCORS Handling: Automatic fallback for cross-origin restrictions\n\n\n\n2.2 Dataset Information\nPrimary dataset (if accessible): - URL: https://z.rslv.xyz/10.5281/zenodo.15278210/isamples_export_2025_04_21_16_23_46_geo.parquet - Size: ~300 MB, 6+ million records - Sources: SESAR, OpenContext, GEOME, Smithsonian\nFallback dataset (if CORS blocked): - Type: Generated demo data with realistic structure - Size: 10K records with same schema and representative geographic distribution - Purpose: Demonstrates all analytical techniques with faster loading",

Add skos matches to URIs from other vocabularies.  2022-09-30 SMR per https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata/issues/109, change specimen to sample in vocabulary names and labels. Add ‘Slurry biome aggregation’ and ‘Bundle biome aggregation’ (github issue 110). Rename ‘liquid or gas’ sample type to ‘fluid in container’ (github issue 108).  2023-07-27 SMR modify base specimen type vocabulary, add ‘Non biologic solid object’ change broader relations in this vocab to use that as parent class where appropriate. Intention is a specimen category for solid objects that are not biologic; this subsumes ‘Fossil’ and ‘Artifact’, but excludes living organism, their parts and products. Obviously there is some overlap with Research specimens.  2023-11-06 SMR add missing inScheme on Non-biologic solid object and solid materal specimen.

    "text": "1 Taxonomies\nOne of the foundations for interoperability of iSamples material sample descriptions is the definition of vocabularies for the categorization of sample type. There are three core vocabularies for different aspects of sample type: material sample type, material type, and sampled feature type. Each vocabulary is maintained as an RDF file using the SKOS vocabulary, with hierarchical relationships using SKOS:broader. In order to be domain agnostic, these core taxonomies cover a small set of top level terms. The taxonomies may be extended as necessary to support more specialized domains by relating additional terms using SKOS:broader and SKOS:narrower.\nThe iSamples core taxonomies are controlled vocabularies with terms related by SKOS:broader and SKOS:narrower. In order to be domain agnostic, the core taxonomies cover a small set of top level terms. The taxonomies may be extended as necessary to support more specialized domains by relating additional terms using SKOS:broader and SKOS:narrower.\nThe iSamples taxonomies are used to characterize three fundamental concepts pertaining to physical samples:\n\nThe “iSamples Materials vocabulary” is a taxonomy of terms used to categorize the composition of a physical sample, that is “What material is the sample composed of?”\nThe “Sampled Feature Type Vocabulary” is a taxonomy of terms used to indicate what the sample is representative of.\nThe “iSamples Specimen Type Vocabulary” is a taxonomy of broad categories that classify what type of spcimen the physical sample record represents.\n\nThree taxonomies are currently defined :\nMaterial Sample (specimen) Type Vocabulary\nMaterials Vocabulary\nSampled Feature (context) Type vocabulary",
