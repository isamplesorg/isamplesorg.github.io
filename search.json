    "text": "2 Understanding Paths in the iSamples Property Graph\n\n2.1 Why “Path 1” and “Path 2”?\nThese terms describe the two main ways to get from a MaterialSampleRecord to geographic coordinates. They’re not the only relationship paths in the graph, but they’re the most commonly used for spatial queries.\nPath 1 (Direct Event Location)\nMaterialSampleRecord\n  → produced_by →\nSamplingEvent\n  → sample_location →\nGeospatialCoordLocation\nPath 2 (Via Sampling Site)\nMaterialSampleRecord\n  → produced_by →\nSamplingEvent\n  → sampling_site →\nSamplingSite\n  → site_location →\nGeospatialCoordLocation\nKey Differences: - Path 1 is direct: Event → Location (3 hops total) - Path 2 goes through Site: Event → Site → Location (4 hops total) - Path 1 = “Where was this specific sample collected?” - Path 2 = “What named site is this sample from, and where is that site?”\nImportant: The queries below use INNER JOIN for both paths, meaning samples must have connections through both paths to appear in results. Samples with only one path will be excluded.\n\n\n2.2 Full Relationship Map (Beyond Path 1 and Path 2)\nThe iSamples property graph contains many more relationships than just the geographic paths:\n                                    Agent\n                                      ↑\n                                      | {responsibility, registrant}\n                                      |\nMaterialSampleRecord ────produced_by──→ SamplingEvent ────sample_location──→ GeospatialCoordLocation\n    |                                       |                                         ↑\n    |                                       |                                         |\n    | {keywords,                            └────sampling_site──→ SamplingSite ──site_location─┘\n    |  has_sample_object_type,\n    |  has_material_category}\n    |\n    └──→ IdentifiedConcept\nPath Categories: - PATH 1: MaterialSampleRecord → SamplingEvent → GeospatialCoordLocation (direct location) - PATH 2: MaterialSampleRecord → SamplingEvent → SamplingSite → GeospatialCoordLocation (via site) - AGENT PATH: MaterialSampleRecord → SamplingEvent → Agent (who collected/registered) - CONCEPT PATH: MaterialSampleRecord → IdentifiedConcept (types, keywords - direct, no event!)\nKey Insight: SamplingEvent is the central hub for most relationships, except concepts which attach directly to MaterialSampleRecord.\n\n\n2.3 Query Pattern Analysis (from Eric Kansa’s open-context-py)\nThe following analysis is based on Eric’s query functions that demonstrate different path traversal patterns:\n\n2.3.1 1. get_sample_data_via_sample_pid - Uses BOTH Path 1 AND Path 2\nMaterialSampleRecord (WHERE pid = ?)\n  → produced_by → SamplingEvent\n    ├─→ sample_location → GeospatialCoordLocation [Path 1]\n    └─→ sampling_site → SamplingSite [Path 2]\n\nReturns: sample metadata + lat/lon + site label/pid\nRequired: BOTH paths must exist (INNER JOIN)\n\n\n2.3.2 2. get_sample_data_agents_sample_pid - Uses AGENT PATH\nMaterialSampleRecord (WHERE pid = ?)\n  → produced_by → SamplingEvent\n    → {responsibility, registrant} → Agent\n\nReturns: sample metadata + agent info (who collected/registered)\nIndependent of: Path 1 and Path 2 (no geographic data)\n\n\n2.3.3 3. get_sample_types_and_keywords_via_sample_pid - Uses CONCEPT PATH\nMaterialSampleRecord (WHERE pid = ?)\n  → {keywords, has_sample_object_type, has_material_category} → IdentifiedConcept\n\nReturns: sample metadata + classification keywords/types\nIndependent of: Path 1, Path 2, and SamplingEvent!\n\n\n2.3.4 4. get_samples_at_geo_cord_location_via_sample_event - REVERSE Path 1 + Path 2\nGeospatialCoordLocation (WHERE pid = ?)  ← START HERE (reverse!)\n  ← sample_location ← SamplingEvent [Path 1 REVERSED]\n    ├─→ sampling_site → SamplingSite [Path 2 enrichment]\n    └─← produced_by ← MaterialSampleRecord [complete chain]\n\nReturns: all samples at a given location + site info\nDirection: geo → samples (opposite of other queries)\nSummary Table:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFunction\nPath 1\nPath 2\nDirection\nNotes\n\n\n\n\nget_sample_data_via_sample_pid\n✅ Required\n✅ Required\nForward\nINNER JOIN - no row if either missing\n\n\nget_sample_data_agents_sample_pid\n❌ N/A\n❌ N/A\nN/A\nUses agent path instead\n\n\nget_sample_types_and_keywords_via_sample_pid\n❌ N/A\n❌ N/A\nN/A\nDirect edges to concepts\n\n\nget_samples_at_geo_cord_location_via_sample_event\n✅ Required\n✅ Required\nReverse\nWalks from geo to samples",

    "text": "6 Geographic Location Classification\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip✅ IMPLEMENTED - Differentiated Geographic Visualization\n\n\n\nCurrent implementation: GeospatialCoordLocations are now color-coded by their semantic role in the property graph:\n\n🔵 Blue (small) - sample_location_only: Precise field collection points (Path 1)\n🟣 Purple (large) - site_location_only: Administrative site markers (Path 2)\n🟠 Orange (medium) - both: Dual-purpose locations (used for both Path 1 and Path 2)\n\nDiscovery: Analysis of the OpenContext parquet data reveals that geos fall into three distinct categories based on their usage:\n\nsample_location_only: Precise field collection points (Path 1)\n\nMost common category\nRepresents exact GPS coordinates where sampling events occurred\nVaries per event, even within the same site\n\nsite_location_only: Administrative site markers (Path 2)\n\nRepresents general/reference locations for named archaeological sites\nOne coordinate per site\nMay not correspond to any actual collection point\n\nboth: 10,346 geos (5.2%) - Dual-purpose locations\n\nUsed as BOTH sample_location AND site_location\nPrimarily single-location sites (85% of all sites)\nOccasionally one of many locations at multi-location sites (e.g., PKAP)\n\n\nSite spatial patterns: - 85.4% of sites are compact (single location) - all events at one coordinate - Example: Suberde - 384 events at one location - 14.6% of sites are distributed (multiple locations) - events spread across space - Example: PKAP Survey Area - 15,446 events across 544 different coordinates - Poggio Civitate - 29,985 events across 11,112 coordinates\n\n6.1 Proposed Enhancement\nVisual differentiation by semantic role:\n// Color coding\nconst styles = {\n  sample_location_only: { color: '#2E86AB', size: 3 },  // Blue - field collection points\n  site_location_only:   { color: '#A23B72', size: 6 },  // Purple - administrative markers\n  both:                 { color: '#F18F01', size: 5 }   // Orange - dual-purpose\n};\nUI Controls:\n☑ Show sample locations (precise field data - Path 1)\n☑ Show site locations (administrative site markers - Path 2)\n☐ Highlight overlap points only (10,346 dual-purpose geos)\nImplementation - Classification Query:\n-- Classify geos by usage type\nWITH geo_classification AS (\n  SELECT\n    geo.pid,\n    geo.latitude,\n    geo.longitude,\n    MAX(CASE WHEN e.p = 'sample_location' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as is_sample_location,\n    MAX(CASE WHEN e.p = 'site_location' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) as is_site_location\n  FROM nodes geo\n  JOIN nodes e ON (geo.row_id = e.o[1])\n  WHERE geo.otype = 'GeospatialCoordLocation'\n  GROUP BY geo.pid, geo.latitude, geo.longitude\n)\nSELECT\n  pid,\n  latitude,\n  longitude,\n  CASE\n    WHEN is_sample_location = 1 AND is_site_location = 1 THEN 'both'\n    WHEN is_sample_location = 1 THEN 'sample_location_only'\n    WHEN is_site_location = 1 THEN 'site_location_only'\n  END as location_type\nFROM geo_classification\n\n\n6.2 Benefits\n\nEducational: Makes Path 1 vs Path 2 distinction visually concrete\n\nUsers can SEE the semantic difference between precise and administrative locations\nDemonstrates the complementary nature of the two geographic paths\n\nExploratory: Enables focused spatial queries\n\n“Show me archaeological sites in Turkey” → filter to site_location_only\n“Where were samples actually collected?” → filter to sample_location_only\n“Which locations serve dual purposes?” → show both category\n\nAnalytical: Reveals site spatial structure\n\nCompact sites: tight cluster of blue points around purple marker\nSurvey areas: purple marker with cloud of blue points spread across region\nIdentifies sampling strategies and field methodologies\n\n\n\n\n6.3 Advanced Features (Future)\nSite Explorer Mode: - Click a site_location (purple marker) → reveal all its sample_locations (blue points) - Draw convex hull or region around the site’s collection points - Display site statistics: event count, spatial extent, temporal range\nExample interaction:\nUser clicks PKAP Survey Area marker (purple)\n→ Highlights 544 blue sample_location points within the survey area\n→ Shows: \"15,446 events across 544 locations (0.7% at site marker, 99.3% elsewhere)\"\n→ Draws polygon boundary around the survey extent\n\n\n6.4 Implementation Status\nStatus: ✅ IMPLEMENTED (Basic color-coding by location type)\nWhat’s implemented: - ✅ Classification query with CTE (lines 123-146) - ✅ Conditional styling by location_type (lines 153-166) - ✅ Color-coded points: Blue (sample_location), Purple (site_location), Orange (both) - ✅ Size differentiation: 3px (field points), 6px (sites), 5px (dual-purpose)\nPerformance impact: - Query execution time increased slightly due to JOIN and GROUP BY - Same 198k points rendered, now with semantic color coding - No noticeable performance degradation in browser rendering\nFuture enhancements (not yet implemented): - ⬜ UI filter controls (checkbox toggles for each location type) - ⬜ Site Explorer Mode (click site → highlight all sample_locations) - ⬜ Convex hull/region drawing for distributed sites - ⬜ Dynamic statistics display on site selection\nThis implementation transforms the visualization from uniform points into a pedagogical tool that visually demonstrates the Path 1 vs Path 2 distinction in the iSamples metadata model architecture.",

Add Dublin core imports.  2022-03-11 SMR change definitions from rdfs:comment to skos:definition. Minor fixes in definitions. Add skos matches to URIs from other vocabularies.  2022-09-30 SMR per https://github.com/isamplesorg/metadata/issues/109, change specimen to sample in vocabulary names and labels. Add ‘Slurry biome aggregation’ and ‘Bundle biome aggregation’ (github issue 110). Rename ‘liquid or gas’ sample type to ‘fluid in container’ (github issue 108).  2023-07-27 SMR modify base specimen type vocabulary, add ‘Non biologic solid object’ change broader relations in this vocab to use that as parent class where appropriate. Intention is a specimen category for solid objects that are not biologic; this subsumes ‘Fossil’ and ‘Artifact’, but excludes living organism, their parts and products. Obviously there is some overlap with Research specimens.  2023-11-06 SMR add missing inScheme on Non-biologic solid object and solid materal specimen. Update version number in URI to 1.0  2024-04-19 SMR update language to always use ‘material sample’ instead of specimen or physical specimen, including in text, labels, and in the URI tokens. Edit defintions to improve clarity.  2024-09-13 remove version numbers from URI\nConcept Hierarchy:"

Samples of naturally occuring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold nuggets) should be considered mineral material. Metallic material is material that when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). The boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved.

    "text": "Taxonomies\nOne of the foundations for interoperability of iSamples material sample descriptions is the definition of vocabularies for the categorization of sample type. There are three core vocabularies for different aspects of sample type: material sample type, material type, and sampled feature type. Each vocabulary is maintained as an RDF file using the SKOS vocabulary, with hierarchical relationships using SKOS:broader. In order to be domain agnostic, these core taxonomies cover a small set of top level terms. The taxonomies may be extended as necessary to support more specialized domains by relating additional terms using SKOS:broader and SKOS:narrower.\nThe iSamples core taxonomies are controlled vocabularies with terms related by SKOS:broader and SKOS:narrower. In order to be domain agnostic, the core taxonomies cover a small set of top level terms. The taxonomies may be extended as necessary to support more specialized domains by relating additional terms using SKOS:broader and SKOS:narrower.\nThe iSamples taxonomies are used to characterize three fundamental concepts pertaining to physical samples:\n\nThe “iSamples Materials vocabulary” is a taxonomy of terms used to categorize the composition of a physical sample, that is “What material is the sample composed of?”\nThe “Sampled Feature Type Vocabulary” is a taxonomy of terms used to indicate what the sample is representative of.\nThe “iSamples Specimen Type Vocabulary” is a taxonomy of broad categories that classify what type of spcimen the physical sample record represents.\n\nThree taxonomies are currently defined :\nMaterial Sample (specimen) Type Vocabulary\nMaterials Vocabulary\nSampled Feature (context) Type vocabulary",

Resolution involves three variables: the IRI, the requested content type, and an optional profile.\nThe IRI provides the location of the resource. Reference to specific items within a resource can be made in two ways: by path (e.g. /resource/element) and by fragment (e.g. resource#element). IRI fragments are not transmitted to a server by a client, hence a fragment identifier is always relative to the retrieved document. The basic rule is thus, the path element reference is used to reference a specific document, then a fragment is used to reference a specific component of the document.\nThe requested content type is presented by a client in the Accept header. If no Accept header is presented by the client or the Accept header is ambiguous (e.g. */*), then the default content type is returned.

Import of GEOME records show that many samples are classified as Kingdom Chromista, but this is missing from this vocabulary extension (https://github.com/isamplesorg/vocabularies/issues/17). Hierarchy and classes reviewed; deprecate Protista and make it an alternate name in Eukaryotic microorganism class and update definition; add Chromista; update scope notes for Eukaryote. Harmonize better with GBIF tree of life: Make Mycetozoa subclass of Protozoa, not subclass of Amoebozoa, add Other Protozoa class for logical completeness. increment version to 1.1; these are not breaking changes, but addition of new class and hierarchy adjustments in protozoa are more than incremental.  2024-09-13 SMR remove version number from URI  Based on draft DiSSCo specimen & collection classification, table 2, https://docs.google.com/document/d/19OPyOm9VF2qfI3M6RmJPvRfo8JlZ3tt0II05aGCyBHQ/ , with added classes to attempt a logical hierarchy.\nConcept Hierarchy:"

Bacteriophages are composed of proteins that encapsulate a DNA or RNA genome, and may have structures that are either simple or elaborate. Their genomes may encode as few as four genes (e.g. MS2) and as many as hundreds of genes. Phages replicate within the bacterium following the injection of their genome into its cytoplasm.

Samples of naturally occurring metallic material (e.g. native copper, gold nuggets) should be considered mineral material. Metallic material is material that when polished or fractured, shows a lustrous appearance, and conducts electricity and heat relatively well. Metals are typically malleable (they can be hammered into thin sheets) or ductile (can be drawn into wires). The boundaries between metals, nonmetals, and metalloids fluctuate slightly due to a lack of universally accepted definitions of the categories involved.

Organic products of agricultural activity are both anthropogenic and organic. Include lab preparations like XRF pellet and rock powders. Examples: ceramics, concrete, slag, (anthropogenic) glass, mine tailing, plaster, waste.\n\n\n\n1.2 Any ice\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/anyice  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Any ice\nImmediately narrower concepts: Frozen water\nDefinition:  a material that is in a solid state under the temperature and pressure conditions of the preserved sample, but is a liquid or gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP).\nNotes:  The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) standard temperature and pressure (STP) is 20°C (68°F) and 1 atm (14.696 psi, 101.325 kPa). This standard is also known as normal temperature and pressure (NTP).\nSamples of non-aqueous ice should be classified as ‘Any ice’, based on decision that distinguishing ‘ice that might or might not be aqueous’ from ‘non-aqueous ice’ does not merit adding another class to the scheme.\n\n1.2.1 Frozen water\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/waterice  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Any ice-&gt;Frozen water\nDefinition:  Water that is in a solid state.\nAlternate labels:  Water ice\n\n\n\n1.3 Biogenic non-organic material\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/biogenicnonorganicmaterial  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Biogenic non-organic material\nDefinition:  Material produced by an organism but not composed of ‘very large molecules of biological origin.’ E.g. bone, tooth, shell, coral skeleton,\n\n\n1.4 Dispersed media\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/dispersedmedia  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Dispersed media\nDefinition:  Material that contains discrete elements of some material dispersed in a continuous fluid medium. The dispersed component can be a gas, a liquid or a solid (based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dispersed_media). Does not include mixtures of granular material like soil, sediment, particulate, or solids that would be considered rock material.\nExample:  aerosol obo:ENVO_00010505, foam obo:ENVO_00005738, emulsion obo:ENVO_00010506, colloidal suspension obo:ENVO_01001560, scum(?) obo:ENVO_00003930. (prefix obo: http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/)\n\n\n1.5 Natural Solid Material\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/earthmaterial  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Natural Solid Material\nImmediately narrower concepts: Mineral, Mixed soil sediment or rock, Particulate, Rock or sediment, Soil\nDefinition:  A naturally occurring solid material that is not anthropogenic, biogenic, or ice.\n\n1.5.1 Mineral\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/mineral  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Natural Solid Material-&gt;Mineral\nDefinition:  Material consists of a single mineral or mineraloid phase. ‘A mineral is an element or chemical compound that is normally crystalline and that has been formed as a result of geological processes.’ (Nickel, Ernest H. (1995), The definition of a mineral, The Canadian Mineralogist. 33 (3): 689–90). Include mineraloids. … A material primarily composed of some substance that is naturally occurring, solid and stable at room temperature, representable by a chemical formula, usually abiogenic, and that has an ordered atomic structure. (http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_01000256). The identity of a mineral species is defined by a crystal structure and a chemical composition that might include various specific elemental substitutions in that structure. Mineraloid: A naturally occurring mineral-like substance that does not demonstrate crystallinity. Mineraloids possess chemical compositions that vary beyond the generally accepted ranges for specific minerals. Examples: obsidian, Opal. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mineraloid)\n\n\n1.5.2 Mixed soil sediment or rock\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/mixedsoilsedimentrock  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Natural Solid Material-&gt;Mixed soil sediment or rock\nDefinition:  Material is mixed aggregation of fragments of undifferentiated soil, sediment or rock origin. e.g. cuttings from some boreholes (rock fragments and caved soil or sediment).\n\n\n1.5.3 Particulate\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/particulate  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Natural Solid Material-&gt;Particulate\nDefinition:  Material consists of microscopic particulate material derived by precipitation, filtering, or settling from suspension in a fluid, e.g. filtrate from water, deposition from atmosphere, astro material particles. Might include mineral, organic, or biological material. ENVO definition (ENVO_01000060) has “composed of microscopic portions of solid or liquid material suspended in another environmental material.” Refine here to define as the solid particles, distinct from a material in which they are suspended. A material that includes solid or liquid particles suspended in another material would be a dispersed_media in this scheme, not defined in ENVO. Human manufactured particulates (e.g. rock powder) should be categorized as ‘Anthropogenic material’ as well as ‘Particulate’\n\n\n1.5.4 Rock or sediment\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/rockorsediment  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Natural Solid Material-&gt;Rock or sediment\nImmediately narrower concepts: Rock, Sediment\nDefinition:  Material is rock or sediment. For example core from boreholes that likely penetrate sediment near the surface and rock at greater depth, with descriptions that do not clearly distinguish non-consolidated sediment from rock.\nNotes:  Use for samples described as rock&gt;sedimentary AND sediment, where it is unclear whether the sample is a consolidated ‘rock’ object, or loose disaggregated material in a bag.\nUse for samples like dredge hauls and ROV scoops that mix rock and sediment from a water body bottom.\nDistinct from ‘Mixed soil, sediment or rock’ that represents samples known to have components of all these materials.\n\n1.5.4.1 Rock\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/rock  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Natural Solid Material-&gt;Rock or sediment-&gt;Rock\nDefinition:  Consolidated aggregate of particles (grains) of rock, mineral (including native elements), mineraloid, or solid organic material. Includes mineral aggregates such as granite, shale, marble; natural glass such as obsidian; organic material formed by geologic processes such a coal; extraterrestrial material in meteorites; and crushed rock fragments like drill cuttings from rock. (based on http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/rock, same as http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00001995)\n\n\n1.5.4.2 Sediment\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/sediment  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Natural Solid Material-&gt;Rock or sediment-&gt;Sediment\nDefinition:  Solid granular material transported by wind, water, or gravity, not modified by interaction with biosphere or atmosphere (to differentiate from soil). Particles might be derived by erosion of pre-existing rock, from shell or other body parts from organisms, precipitated chemically in the surficial environment, or generated by explosive volcanic activity. (http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/lithology/sediment). Sediment is not consolidated, i.e. the particulate constituents do not adhere to each other strongly enough that the aggregate can be considered a solid material in its own right. Similar to http://purl.obolibrary.org/obo/ENVO_00002007\nNotes:  Note that this category includes chemical sediments that might preciptate to form a solid mass, e.g. preciptitates forming vents at submarine hot springs, or gypsum and halite deposites formed by evaporation in hypersaline lakes. (http://resource.geosciml.org/classifier/cgi/consolidationdegree/consolidated).\nTephra is subclass of sediment because it is generally not lithified, in which case it would be considered Rock.\n\n\n\n1.5.5 Soil\n\nURI https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/soil  defined in vocabulary https://w3id.org/isample/vocabulary/material/materialsvocabulary\nPath from the top concept: Material-&gt;Natural Solid Material-&gt;Soil\nDefinition:  Mixed granular mineral and organic matter modified by interaction between earth material, biosphere, and atmosphere, consisting of varying proportions of sand, silt, and clay, organic material such as humus, gases, liquids, and a broad range of resident micro- and macroorganisms. (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soil) Soil consists of horizons near the Earth’s surface that, in contrast to the underlying parent material, have been altered by the interactions of climate, relief, and living organisms over time.

Unlike traditional relational databases or pure graph databases, this approach stores both entities (nodes) and relationships (edges) in a single table structure.\n\n1.1 Why a Property Graph?\nArchaeological and specimen data inherently forms a network:\n\nSamples are collected at sites during events\nSites have geographic locations\nSamples have material types from controlled vocabularies\nPeople (agents) have various roles in the collection process\n\nThis interconnected nature makes a graph model ideal for representing the complex relationships while maintaining query performance."

Both paths yield over 1M samples each.\n\n\n9.4 Debugging Lessons Learned\n\nNever assume direct relationships exist - always verify the graph structure first\nTrace step-by-step - build from simple entity counts to complex joins\nTest multiple paths - property graphs often have alternative routes\nValidate results - sanity check your numbers against known entity counts"
